     <h1>More About Me</h1>
     <img src="images/me.jpg" alt="me">
     <p>There is not one but many things that I beleive I can do and do well.
        I enjoy working with my hands, using my brain to solve problems,
        and love expressing my creativity in anything and everything that I do.</p>

   <div class="side1" style="text-align: center;">
     <h1>Crafty Creative Inspired</h1>
     <img src="images/collage2.png" alt="collage2">
     <p>I enjoy creative projects. Painting, decorating, cooking, gardening
       and other crafts have become an outlet for my creativity. I also play guitar,
       write music and sing in church. When I am challenged with a new project I am inspired
       to give it my full attention and do it to the best of my abilities.</p>

   <div class="side2" style="text-align: center;">
     <h1>My Family</h1>
     <img src="images/collage3.png" alt="collage3">
     <p>Jesus and my family are the most important in my life. I live with my husband,
        two boys, and our dog out in "the country". We live on an 80-acre cattle farm (landlord's)
        and have free-range chickens. My sister and her family run a beautiful farm
        that I get to be inspired by. My husband's family is also a huge part of our life
        and my oldest son started playing billiards for the Jr. APA League at their pool hall.</p>

   <div class="bottom1" style="text-align: center;">
     <h1>Outdoor Hobbies</h1>
     <img src="images/collage.png" alt="collage">
     <p>I love the outdoors and exploring nature.
        The fam and I go out to hunt mushrooms(morels), shed hunting with my dog(antlers),
        and we love going fishing and camping. I learned how to tap trees and make syrup.
        I enjoy hunting with my dad for deer and turkey when we are able.</p>
