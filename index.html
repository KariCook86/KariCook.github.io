              <p> My name is Kari Cook and I am 36 years old. I am a Christian, been married for 13 years,
                have 2 boys and a dog-child. Through struggles and hardships I have learned to adapt
                and overcome challenges I have faced. I am learning more about who I am with every
                step I take in a positive direction.</p>

            <h1>Education Struggles Overcome</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 1em;">When I was in high school I was homeschooled. Little did I know that when
                it was time to graduate that I could not get my diploma through the church
                I was obtaining resources from. So, I attempted to go back to school but they would only
                allow me to start over. I completed one year of 9th grade at 18 years old and trying to work.
                I decided 3 more years of public schools was not for me so I attempted classes
                for the GED and did not follow through. Four years ago I was inspired to be an example
                to my boys and try again. At the Dream Center they offered child-care to me so I could study.
                The test was called the HiSet and I studied for 3 months, twice a week, and eventually
                passed each of the four tests. I was encouraged by the OTC HiSet teacher, Jaydean Miller,
                to keep pursuing an education. I am now a college student and soon to be graduate.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="inner mid2">
            <h1>Current Education & Certification</h1>
            <p>I have been enrolled and attending online classes at OTC for almost 4 years. I have a Certificate
               in Accounting and will graduate with an Associates Degree in Accounting and Business Management by the end of 2022.</p>

            <h1>Inspired by WebDev</h1>
            <p>I happened upon an elective class for Website Development that has really sparked interest in me.
            I have learned many skills about WebDev that I will be able to utilize in future career choices.
            This ignition has even made me rethink continuing my education for Website Development.</p>
